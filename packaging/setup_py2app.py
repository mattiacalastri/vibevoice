"""py2app build: python3 packaging/setup_py2app.py py2app (run from repo root).

Fallback if py2app can't cope (document WHY in the commit):
  pyinstaller --windowed --name VibeVoice --icon assets/icon/VibeVoice_LED.icns vibevoice.py
  then: check libportaudio via `otool -L` and graft with install_name_tool.

This file is the ONLY place the shipped bundle's identity is declared — icon,
name, version, usage strings. `packaging/install_dev_app.sh` reads the same
OPTIONS through py2app's alias mode, so the daily driver and the release
bundle cannot drift apart in what they claim to be (sess.9767: the release
bundle was still shipping the retired teal waveform icon that BRAND.md forbids
by name, and calling itself "Copyright not specified").
