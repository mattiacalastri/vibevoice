"""Session-wide safety net for the VibeVoice suite.

Two problems, one cause: the engine finishes its work on **daemon threads**, so
a worker can outlive the test that started it.

1. It can reach the real keyboard. `autosend()` pastes via the clipboard and
   `type_text()` posts synthetic keystrokes into whatever app is frontmost —
   which is exactly what happened on 2026-08-02, when the streaming-paste tests
   typed "il polpo ha" into the user's screen and overwrote their clipboard.
2. It can land in the NEXT test's recorder. A leaked worker running the real
   Whisper on a buffer of zeros (which hallucinates "Grazie a tutti.") called
   `engine.autosend` while a later test in another file had monkeypatched it,
   and that test failed with a paste it never made.

Both disappear if the real outbound functions are simply never installed during
a test session. A test that wants to observe a paste still monkeypatches them
per-test: function-scoped `monkeypatch` layers on top of these no-ops and
reverts to the no-ops, never to the real thing.

    The second half is not redundant with the per-test fixtures. Those use
    function-scoped `monkeypatch`, which is undone at teardown — so a worker
    that outlives its test finds the module attribute restored to the user's
    real `~/.vibevoice/` and writes there. Measured 2026-08-02: 13 phantom rows
    in the live metrics.jsonl, each 0.1 s of audio transcribed as "Grazie a
    tutti.", which then skewed the KPI report enough to make a decode-latency
    problem look three times worse than it is. Telemetry you cannot trust is
