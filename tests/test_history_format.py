"""Formatting of one history entry (never touches live ~/.vibevoice).

`history.jsonl` is written by the engine on the transcription path — the one place
that must never raise and never block — so a torn or malformed line is a real
possibility, not a hypothetical. The settings window renders that file; one bad
line must not blank the whole list.

The timestamp has always been in the file and was always discarded, leaving the
list unable to answer "when did I say that?".
