"""Does saving from the settings window restart the engine only when it must?
(never touches live ~/.vibevoice)

`config.engine_restart_needed` has its own unit tests, but they would stay green
even if the call site went back to restarting unconditionally — and the call site
is where the defect lived: ticking "Dock icon" killed the transcription in flight.

The callback itself (`settingsChanged_`) cannot be driven from a test: PyObjC
requires a real Objective-C `self` for anything exposed as a selector. That is why
the decision was moved out into `vibevoice.apply_settings`, which is what these
tests exercise. What remains inside the selector is two statements of wiring —
read the controls, obey the answer.
