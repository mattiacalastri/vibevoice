vibevoice.py — VibeVoice "Dynamic Island" STT pill + robot command center

A minimal floating UI for a speech-to-text engine. A borderless, floating,
non-activating NSPanel docked under the notch. Decoupled from the engine: it
READS the state files written by the engine and draws. It never touches the
audio pipeline directly.

  idle          → invisible (alpha 0)
  recording     → fade-in, live waveform
  transcribing  → keeps drawing the transcript that streams in
  silence       → fade-out after ~1.5s (or ~2.5s while text is shown)

A floating ROBOT widget doubles as the command center: click it for the menu,
drag it to reposition (persisted). It exists because on recent macOS a status
item created before launch-finish can be parked off-screen behind the notch —
the robot is our own deterministic, always-visible control. The menu-bar status
item is still created (and self-heals if parked); both share the same menu.

STATE-FILE CONTRACT (shared pill <-> engine, under ~/.vibevoice/):
  ~/.vibevoice/state       text file, one of: idle | recording | transcribing
  ~/.vibevoice/levels.bin  60 float32 little-endian (RMS 0..1), atomic write
  ~/.vibevoice/raw.txt     last transcription, plain text (just the sentence)
  ~/.vibevoice/partial.txt live draft while you are still speaking (absent = none)
  ~/.vibevoice/history.jsonl  last 20 transcriptions, JSONL {"ts","text"}, newest last

The engine WRITES these files; the pill READS them.

CONTROL FILES (this pill WRITES them; the engine / this pill honor them — the
same external-control pattern as autosend's pause flag, NOT engine-owned state):
  ~/.vibevoice/muted       presence = mic paused (engine ignores audio, stays alive)
  ~/.vibevoice/locked      presence = pill stays visible (no auto-hide)
  ~/.vibevoice/autosend    "on" | "off" — armed state of the auto-Return daemon
                           (autosend.py owns this file; the pill toggles it and
                           spawns the daemon when it isn't already running)

OPTIONAL TTS-REACTIVITY (self-contained hook; ANY external text-to-speech may
write these, the pill only READS them — no engine/autosend change needed):
  ~/.vibevoice/tts         presence = the feature is enabled
  ~/.vibevoice/tts.txt     line 1: "<start_epoch> <duration_s>"; line 2+: spoken text
  ~/.vibevoice/tts_levels.bin  60 float32 LE (RMS 0..1) of the TTS audio
When tts.txt is present and fresh, the pill turns RED and types out the spoken
sentence in sync with the audio (a mirror of the green dictation waveform).

  ~/.vibevoice/robot_pos   "x,y" — saved position of the floating robot (drag)
  ~/.vibevoice/widget      presence = hardware-look voice widget shown (menu toggle)
  ~/.vibevoice/widget_pos  "x,y" — saved position of the hardware widget (drag)

Menu / robot acts as the master switch:
  - toggle the engine (launches/kills engine.py via subprocess)
  - Mute mic (pause without killing the engine)
  - Lock pill (pin it so it never auto-hides)
  - Auto-send loop (arm autosend.py: every dictation → automatic Return)
  - Restart / Quit

Run:
  python3 vibevoice.py            # live (reads the engine state files)
  python3 vibevoice.py --demo     # animated demo (to preview the design)
  python3 vibevoice.py --place    # placement mode (stays visible)

    `CFBundleIconFile` / `CFBundleName` in the .app only apply when the *bundle*

    inherits the identity of Homebrew's `Python.app` — a rocket labelled
    "Python" (sess.9757). Both halves need fixing and they need different fixes:

    * the icon is a property of the running NSApplication → set the image;
    * the name is read from the main bundle's info dictionary → patch that
      dictionary. It is mutable in place, and this is the same approach the
      menu-bar libraries use. It must happen before AppKit reads the name for
      the Dock tile, so this runs early in `main()`.

    A no-op for the real bundle, which already declares both. Cosmetic by
    definition: any failure here must leave dictation untouched.
