"""Do the tests actually catch the bugs they were written for?

A green suite says the code passes its tests. It does not say the tests would
notice if the code stopped working. This removes each cure from a throwaway copy
of the repo and runs the test that claims to guard it: the test must FAIL. One
that passes anyway is not a guard, it is a reassurance — and it earned its place
here by being found in the wild on 2026-08-02, hiding among 190 green tests.

Each entry is a scar with a name: the mutation reverts a specific fix, and the
named test is the one that should scream. Add an entry whenever you fix a defect
that could plausibly come back.

Read-only against the repo — every mutation happens in a copy under the system
temp dir.

Usage:
    python3 tools/verify_mutations.py            # all of them
    python3 tools/verify_mutations.py apostrofo  # only entries matching a word
